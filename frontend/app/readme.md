# Front-end

this directory is for the oSPARC front-end code as developed by @mendlen and @Koustubh2111

Depending on user story, 
- Device design or selection
- Nerve selection or properties input or file upload
- Selection of stimulation to run (fast or thorough, selection of relevent outputs) (I expect most of these to be placeholders)
- enter email for where data output gets sent
