function [locs,pks]=peakseek(x,minpeakdist,minpeakh)
% Alternative to the findpeaks function.  This thing runs much much faster.
% It really leaves findpeaks in the dust.  It also can handle ties between
% peaks.  Findpeaks just erases both in a tie.  Shame on findpeaks.
%
% x is a vector input (generally a timecourse)
% minpeakdist is the minimum desired distance between peaks (optional, defaults to 1)
% minpeakh is the minimum height of a peak (optional)
