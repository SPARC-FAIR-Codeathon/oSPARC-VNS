unmyelinated axon diameter histograms were derived from the data shown in: 

SCHMALBRUCH 1986
Table 4: Number and diameter of the unmyelinated axons in branches of
the sciatic nerve of a normal rat as compared to a rat in which the
autonomic fibers have been eliminated. 

Neither SCHMALBRUCH nor IKADA has actual unmyelinated distributions. Since 
sciatic is not visceral nerve, finding more accurate data is left as an
exercise to the student.
